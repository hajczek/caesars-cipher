# PROJECT 'CAESARS CIPHER'

'Caesars Cipher' is made with JavaScript.

## HOW THIS CODE IS WORKING

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher.<br/>
In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.<br/>
A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. <br/>
Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.<br/>
Function rot13(str) takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

## HOW TO CHECK THIS CODE

For run this code you must use some of code like this with the text, which is write with Cesars Cipher code:

rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC");
